In this project I Analysed the effect of some features like age and sex on the location of cancerÂ¶
Firstly I tried to check dataset to figure out if there is missing value by DataFrame.describe() function. 
Then I clean missong values by DF.dropna() 
I darwed some scatter plot to detet noises and finally I clean all noises.
